        <h1>Edutools for Notion - Terms of Use</h1>
        <p>
            There's not much that we offer, so there's not much that we have to restrict. However, there are some terms and conditions to using our service:
        </p>
        <ul>

            <li>You must not make any attempt to damage the service or reduce its availability for others.</li>
            <li>You must not make any attempt to bypass the security of the platform.</li>
            <li>You must not make any attempt to bypass the rate limiting</li>
            <li>You must not make any attempt to access another person's database.</li>

            This service is offered with no uptime guarantee, not even a hint of one. It may go down at any time. It should not be relied on. Although the API is simple to reverse-engineer and you are free to use it (within the rate limit), you should not rely on its availability.

        </ul>
